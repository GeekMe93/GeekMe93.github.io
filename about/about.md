<p class="message">
  I am currently a graduate student in <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg">National University of Singapore</a>. More details about me, please refer to my <a href="/resume/">Résumé</a> page (<a href="/files/mycv.pdf">pdf</a>). Besides doing research, one of the very interesting thing for me is writing and sharing something in this website.
</p>
This sites will mainly focus on:

- Notes about research in materials science and computer science.
- Tutorials about what I am currently working on.
- Some projects which can improve the efficiency of my research.  

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted by [github](https://github.com). The website template wad forked from [lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) (@mdo), I also took some css styling from [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui) and Prof. [Philip Guo](http://www.pgbovine.net/). I made some minor changes. The posts or articles in this website might be misleading, if you have different opinions, please drop me an email.
