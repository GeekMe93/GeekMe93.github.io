Workflow of research can greatly improve by a good typesetting tool (LaTeX), a programming language (Python), a communication and sharing platform (website). Don't forget to refine everything accordingly.

Research workfow is very important issue on how to conduct effective research. [Prof. Philip Guo](http://www.pgbovine.net) in University of Rochester talked the workflow for data scientist or for those who working in computer science. As budding researcher in materials science, the concept of workflow is equally important whether you are aimed at the academia or the industry. My ideas of workflow in experiment based research is basically an reflection on the interaction of individual habit and efficient professionism.

Specifically, I'd like to divide all these workflow stuff into three parts.

- Find and match
- Individualization
- Refinement


### Finding the appropriate tools for you to start

This is the initial stage, my experience is that you should choose the best **tools** based on your knowledge and research field. The first step in this phase is analyzing what are you going to work in your field of research. Technically, I'd like to classify my work into `experiment`, `analysis`, `presentation`. Actually, we further divide this three parts into more detailed parts. For example, analysis includes the data interpretation and data presentation, etc. No matter what is the criterion to classify all these thing, I personally think there is one thing which is very basic and it connects all these part together. His name is called ***recoding***. 

This is a broad topic, generally speaking, it includes record of your paper review, experiment data, life reflection, technical article, notes and tutorials, CV, etc. Good recoding can keep your research flow in a sensible logic and seamless way. In order to achieve the goal of good recoding, I personally choose the following tools.

> 1. You need to a academic and professional documentation preparation system.
> 2. You need to master a certain programming language.
> 3. You need a platform to share to ideas.

The most recommended typesetting system is [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org). I have tried many other similar projects (lke Markdown), no one has the power as that of LaTex. Markdown is simple and easy to learn, which sacrificed the professionism and flexible customization. It will drive you crazy when you need something special although it is indeed a good tools for simple note-taking. How to tame LaTeX into your pet will be introduced in the second part of this article.

When talking about programming, some students would have thought it is daunting and meaningless to master certain programming language, especially considering we research students are burdened with research tasks. But, I want to argue is that it is NOT an excuse to give up such a useful tools. Current research work is deeply involved with interaction with computer, so with an aid with certain programming language, you can greatly improve your efficiency. Just leave some tedious repeated work to the computer, take more time to research and life. The language here I recommended is [Python](https://www.python.org). 

The last but not the least, we need a platform to communicate and share what we have learned. Probably as a future bee in academia, I think personal website dose no bad in this aspect. I found tons of interesting people through their web, I learn from them even though we never met in real life. Besides this, this could serve as a storage of you ideas and thought, you supervisor can visited this site, then he or she will know your recent situation without emailing you if there is actually no need. 

### Individualizing and customizing your stuff

Now, you are ready to the special one with all of these tools. Let's first start with LaTeX. Normally, one word can really summarized in this part: **templates, templates, and templates!**. Please construct and refine templates for:

> 1. Literature review;
> 2. Research report;
> 3. Lecture notes;
> 4. Beamer presentation;
> 5. Assignment;
> 6. CV;

I won't talk too much about Python now. Here I only listed what I could do with great libraries of Python.

> 1. Numeric and Scientific work  with packages (here is the [list](https://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific));
> 2. Quick note-taking with [Ipython notebook](http://jupyter.org);
> 3. [Future] There are some great DFT code using Python and it's free;

Finally, the personal website set-up can be somewhat technical for non-CS student. You may required to have a little bit knowledge about `html`, `css`, `JavaScript` if you really want to customize you website. Without much deviating from our original purpose, choosing a matured platform (like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org)) would be better. I personally choose [Github](https://github.com)+ [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for taste and individual purpose. If you have it set up, then ***write and behave professionally***.

I know I omit some details, but main idea is stated in summary box.
