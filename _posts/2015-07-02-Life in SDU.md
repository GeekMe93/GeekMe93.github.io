Life in Shandong University

After the graduation ceremony, I left the city that I lived during my college life. Like the summary I made after leaving NCKU, I do think there is need to make short summary about life in Shandong University. Reflection on the past life from now, there is always something I haven't down yet. I'd like to summarized in the aspects of study, friends, future.


### Academic life

#### Year one

This is an exciting year,  I made a lot of so-called achievements: First-Class scholarship, Excellent Student of Shandong University, Core member of the class committee. It seems that this was a wonderful year, I have reached what other peer student want to achieve. I make things perfect as far as I can. In the eyes of other, I should be happy, and satisfied with all these honors and awards. But the reality is not. I could get A in my courses, but I am still confused what I truly love and feel passionate for. One word to describe freshman life is ***confusion***. 

#### Year two

I am seeking change, I am preparing something for going out. This is the stage I truly think about what I like to do in the future. My short-term goal at that time is going out to be an exchange student. Switching an environment might be a booster for me. I put less emphasis on study, I do some side projects involved in Matlab and C, trying exploring something which can be combined with materials science to make it more interesting and concrete. The project had no end result, but it has seeded in my heart. One word in year two is ***exploration***.

#### Year three

I finally got out! This is golden year of me in every aspects. I had the very freedom to choose whatever I'd like to learn. I gradually transformed from Chinese-based study mode to an English one. My self-learning ability increased exponentially which surprised myself. I even didn't care about any score, I just enjoy the process of learning and discussion. This kind of feeling is great for me. This half year is the milestone.

#### Year four

Application and final year project are two themes during this year. At the same time, I picked up the old side projects in year two and combined it wit my FYP. I gained a general overview of interdisciplinary research and decided to fight for it. And luckily I wad admitted by NGS, which could really provide me the platform. This could count as the final fruit.

### Friends

My friends really inspired me in every works of life and research. In Shandong University, Xiaoshi and Wei really helped me a lot. You guys took me out from my depression and always gave me courage and hope. Gratitude also are delivered Tiange, Ziwei and Mike, we were always eating and talking on funny things of ourself and others. You guys are laughter maker. In NCKU, Chao is just like a mentor, you still could inspired me even when we went back to our original school. Without your help, I won't be in NUS. Hao-Chun, talking and discussing with you is pleasant thing, I appreciate your attitude to life, your personality really have a good influence on me. Thank you, mates! You guys are shaping my mind. 

### Future

A few words about future:

> 1. having a clear goal;
> 2. working with passion;
> 3. learning with heart;
> 4. making good friends;
> 5. reflection --> refine --> implement
